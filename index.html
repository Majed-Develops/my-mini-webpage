    <h2>More about me!</h2>

    <p>I always loved code (..even when it took me 2 decades to start the process..), but hey, I mean better late then never, right?</p>
    <p>Far from code, I love cars and bikes. Driving and / or riding always give me that sense of control and freedom. I infact drive whatever the case, happy or sad, stressed or relaxed, 
        with friends or with no one as a backpack or on my side. It's something that makes me feel alive to be honest, and when life hits hard, a steering mechanism, gas pedal, and wheels can bring back that sense of control.
    </p>
    <p>I started my cars journey since I was a very young kid. My father used to read newspapers everydays and gt new ones every Friday, and those newspapers always had car ads on them, and
        what i would do is take the newspapers he no longer needs, bring out my scissors and glue, and find absolutely any ad about a car, cut it out, and stick it onto my door closet from the inside.
        My toys as well, they were all car-related toys. From RC cars to figure cars, Hot Wheels or those cars you buy from Al-Hussein Toys.
    </p>
    <p>In my house-hold, being an Arab, we have that "Aladdin-style carpet" in each possible room (except the bathrooms tho... nasty smells if water drops on them...). Anyways, I remember
        loving them, and the bigger they are, the more I love them. Wanna know why? They were "my small city", where the table in the center acts a "Car Hub", (not a garage because those tables were too 
        big when comparing them to my toy cars), any ways, and that carpet had border lines to the ends of them, where to me, they appeared more as a road and a sidewalk. Now, with table in the center,
        and the "road and sidewalks", this carpet was a small city of cars, and I would bring absolutely any toy car I have, but it must fit in between the borderlines, and play for hours and hours,
        and enjoy every single minute. Good days man, good days..</p>

        <p>Later on in life, I started the big biy toys, where I would "<span class="tooltip" style="font-style: italic; color:blue">borrow<span class="tooltiptext">Took the car without permission.</span>"</span> my fathers car and drive in the neighborhood and then took it to the highway.</p>
        <p>Motorcycles too where something I rode as a kid. We lived in a bouggie neighborhood, and in that neighborhood, we had a guy who would use a <span class="tooltipimgtext" style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Suzuki Swish 125<img class="tooltipimg" src="/images/suzuki-swish-125-facelift-standard-800.avif" alt="suzuki swish 125 photo"></span> to transport inside the neighborhood and clean other cars.
            What I would do is take my school allowance before sunrise and offer him to take the bike for that allownace, and that guy would agree. I don't remember how many times I did this, I just remember the last time I rode it was 
            when I was parking infront of him and dropped it as I was hopping off, and that was the last time I rode that bike.
        </p>
        <p>Also as a kid, I found my appretiation for code, and as a kid, I used to play with the terminal code color, switching between green and red and yellow and so on, but as I grew up, I stopped thinking about code or computers,
            and was mainy busy being a "teen through puberty phases".

    <h3>Photos Section</h3>
    <p>As I said above, I love cars, and in this section, I want to show the cars I owned, and the favorite cars I got the chance to drive.</p>
    <p>I used to own a Cadillac Escalade 2002 (Red Wine Color). A <span style="font-weight: bold">6.0L V8 RWD </span>SUV, the best car I got the chance to own, not because it was a "classy" car, it was faaaar from that, in fact, it was the absolute opposite
        of classy or fancy, and you can tell from seeing it from afar that a broke teen is driving it, and that is why I loved it!</p>

        <div id="cadillacPhotoSection"></div>

        <p>I also got the chance to drive the Chevrolet Malibu LT 2016 (2015 Facelift). A phenomenal car guys, I can tell you.
            A fancy "Mercedes-Benz" like interior surrounding lights (Blue), but they looked <span style="font-weight: bold">A-M-A-Z-I-N_G</span>. The car was a <span style="font-weight: bold">2.5L 4 CYL engine</span>, and sort of light-weight (approx: 1560 KG), and 196 HP, this car was fun to drive. To me, this weight is considered light for a 
        city sedan car, and I enjoyed taking it wherever the road stretched.</p>

        <p>These are some of the cars I used ack then, the list goes on, but it's best to move to the second category, <span style="font-weight: bolder";>Motorcycles</span>. I rode several motorcycle as well,
        but only owned one, a <span class="tooltipbiketext">Yamaha FZ150i<img class="tooltipbike" src="/images/yamaha-fz150i.jpeg" alt="yamaha FZ-150i 2017"></span>, but it was a fully convertd bike.</p>
        <p>My bike was called, "Eagle", because it had an eagle frontend that pierced through the wind as the engine roars through the vast Malaysian roads. An amazing bike, and I miss it everyday.</p>
        <p class="fzStatement" style="font-weight: bold;">Click this button to view the view Eagle.</p>
